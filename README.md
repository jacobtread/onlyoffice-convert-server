# OnlyOffice Convert Server

Simple lightweight server for converting office file formats into PDF files built on top of the x2t utility within OnlyOffice

This repository contains two separate crates, the first being `onlyoffice-convert-server` which is the binary crate for the server itself. The second is `onlyoffice-convert-client` in the client directory which is a library crate providing a client for interacting with the server.
